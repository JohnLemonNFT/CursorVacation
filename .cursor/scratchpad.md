## Current Status / Progress Tracking
- [x] User can upload a new avatar.

## Next Steps
- Continue testing other functionalities to ensure overall application stability.
- Monitor for any new issues or bugs that may arise.

## Known Issues
- Need to verify all trip-related functionality
- May need additional testing for edge cases
- Cache version consistency needs monitoring

## Lessons Learned
1. Simpler auth state handling is more reliable
2. Consistent cache versioning is crucial
3. Clear error messages improve user experience
4. Regular testing helps identify issues early
