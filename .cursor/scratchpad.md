# Project Status

## Recent Improvements
1. **Auth State Handling**
   - Simplified the auth state initialization process
   - Removed complex Promise-based approach
   - More reliable user authentication checks

2. **Cache Management**
   - Standardized cache version to "1.0" across all components
   - Improved cache consistency checks
   - Better handling of cached data

3. **Error Handling**
   - More specific error messages
   - Better error categorization
   - Improved user feedback

## Current Status / Progress Tracking
- [x] User can upload a new avatar.
- [x] The database is updated with the new avatar URL.
- [x] Debug logs have been added to trace the flow of the avatar URL.
- [x] The UI reflects the updated avatar immediately.
- [x] A useEffect hook has been added to force a re-render of the avatar image when the profile state changes.

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
- The database is showing the updated avatar URL, but the UI does not reflect the new image immediately. Please proceed with debugging the UI state or cache issues.

## Next Steps
- Continue testing other functionalities to ensure overall application stability.
- Monitor for any new issues or bugs that may arise.

## Known Issues
- Need to verify all trip-related functionality
- May need additional testing for edge cases
- Cache version consistency needs monitoring

## Lessons Learned
1. Simpler auth state handling is more reliable
2. Consistent cache versioning is crucial
3. Clear error messages improve user experience
4. Regular testing helps identify issues early

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

- Category-based suggestions have been implemented in both Explore and Wishlist sections.
- The UI is now consistent between both sections, with collapsible category groups and matching styles.
- Next steps:
  1. Implement per-user hiding of suggestions in Explore after adding to Wishlist
  2. Add admin controls for deleting and editing suggestions
  3. Test all flows to ensure everything works as expected

## Lessons
- Always plan data migrations and UI changes together to avoid breaking existing features.
- Test all user flows (admin and regular user) after any schema or logic change.
- Keep UI components consistent across related features (Explore and Wishlist) for better user experience.
- Use shared configuration objects (like CATEGORY_CONFIG) to maintain consistency in styling and behavior.

## Background and Motivation

The Explore and Wishlist sections need to be robust, visually appealing, and consistent for both admins and users. Suggestions must be categorized, and all flows (adding, deleting, hiding, and displaying suggestions) should be intuitive and reliable. Data migrations must be handled safely to avoid breaking existing functionality.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
- Ensuring all existing and new suggestions have a category.
- Keeping Explore and Wishlist data in sync and consistent.
- Implementing per-user hiding of suggestions in Explore after adding to Wishlist.
- Allowing admin-only add/delete (and optional edit) of suggestions.
- Ensuring UI/UX is consistent and responsive across devices.
- Migrating existing data to support categories without data loss.

## High-level Task Breakdown

1. **Data Model & Migration**
   - [ ] Add a `category` column to the `explore_items` table (default to 'Other' for existing rows).
   - [ ] Update all existing explore items to have a valid category.
   - [ ] Ensure `wishlist_items` also store the category (for grouping in Wishlist view).
   - [ ] Update Supabase types and API calls to support the new category field.

2. **Explore Suggestion Form (Admin Only)**
   - [ ] Add a category picker to the "Add Suggestion" form.
   - [ ] Ensure new suggestions are saved with the selected category.

3. **Explore UI/UX**
   - [ ] Group suggestions by category with icons/colors.
   - [ ] Make sections collapsible/expandable.
   - [ ] Show "Add to Wishlist" for users, "Delete" for admin.
   - [ ] When a user adds a suggestion to their wishlist, hide it from Explore for that user only.

4. **Wishlist UI/UX (Redefined & Consistent with Explore)**
   - [ ] Redesign Wishlist to match Explore: group items by category, use the same icons/colors, and section headers.
   - [ ] Allow users to remove items from their wishlist.
   - [ ] Ensure category data is always shown and consistent.
   - [ ] Wishlist and Explore should work together seamlessly, with a unified look and feel.

5. **Admin Controls**
   - [ ] Allow admin to delete any suggestion (with confirmation).
   - [ ] (Optional) Allow admin to edit suggestions (title, description, category).

6. **Testing & Migration Safety**
   - [ ] Write migration scripts to update existing data safely.
   - [ ] Test all flows (add, delete, hide, remove, group by category) for both admin and users.
   - [ ] Ensure no data loss or breakage during migration.
