# Project Status

## Recent Improvements
1. **Auth State Handling**
   - Simplified the auth state initialization process
   - Removed complex Promise-based approach
   - More reliable user authentication checks

2. **Cache Management**
   - Standardized cache version to "1.0" across all components
   - Improved cache consistency checks
   - Better handling of cached data

3. **Error Handling**
   - More specific error messages
   - Better error categorization
   - Improved user feedback

## Current Status / Progress Tracking
- [x] User can upload a new avatar.
- [x] The database is updated with the new avatar URL.
- [x] Debug logs have been added to trace the flow of the avatar URL.
- [ ] The UI does not reflect the new avatar immediately, even after a refresh.
- [ ] A useEffect hook has been added to force a re-render of the avatar image when the profile state changes.

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
- The database is showing the updated avatar URL, but the UI does not reflect the new image immediately. Please proceed with debugging the UI state or cache issues.

## Next Steps
- Test the application to verify if the UI now reflects the updated avatar immediately.
- If the issue persists, further debugging of the UI state or cache issues may be required.

## Known Issues
- Need to verify all trip-related functionality
- May need additional testing for edge cases
- Cache version consistency needs monitoring

## Lessons Learned
1. Simpler auth state handling is more reliable
2. Consistent cache versioning is crucial
3. Clear error messages improve user experience
4. Regular testing helps identify issues early
