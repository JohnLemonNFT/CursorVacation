# Project Status

## Recent Improvements
1. **Auth State Handling**
   - Simplified the auth state initialization process
   - Removed complex Promise-based approach
   - More reliable user authentication checks

2. **Cache Management**
   - Standardized cache version to "1.0" across all components
   - Improved cache consistency checks
   - Better handling of cached data

3. **Error Handling**
   - More specific error messages
   - Better error categorization
   - Improved user feedback

## Current Status
- Application is now working or partially working
- Recent changes have improved stability
- Further testing needed to verify all functionality

## Next Steps
1. **Testing Plan**
   - Test trip creation and management
   - Verify member access and permissions
   - Check data persistence and caching
   - Test offline functionality
   - Verify error handling in various scenarios

2. **Data Reset**
   - Created tools for clearing database and cache
   - Ready to perform fresh testing when needed
   - Can be accessed via `/debug/clear-data` page

## Known Issues
- Need to verify all trip-related functionality
- May need additional testing for edge cases
- Cache version consistency needs monitoring

## Lessons Learned
1. Simpler auth state handling is more reliable
2. Consistent cache versioning is crucial
3. Clear error messages improve user experience
4. Regular testing helps identify issues early
